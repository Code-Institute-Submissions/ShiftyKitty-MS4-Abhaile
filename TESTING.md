## Bugs Encountered
12/12/2021: <br>
Project Abhaile was deployed today and sent out to friends and family to test and break. 

This is what has comeback:

#### Profile Image Issue
![Willy-prof_img_issue](testing_img_docs/willy-profimg_issue.png)

- Logo saved not appearing on business profile.
- After testing further the issue is that image uploaded had spaces in filename which has caused an issue materializng from DB. 
- Fix: Have introduced new if statement that initiates flash message telling user that filenames must not include any gaps. Tested and working.

#### Offer Image Extension not allowed
![Willy-offer_img_issue](testing_img_docs/willy-offerimg_extensionnotallowed.png)

- Offer image extension not permitted. Meaning that attempted upload extension was not a recognised extension from the ALLOWED_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS in app.py. 
- After testing further the issue is that extension was .webp
- Fix: Have added .webp extension to ALLOWED_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS in app.py. 


#### Business Sign Up - No Filename
![Colm-no_filename_issue](testing_img_docs/colm-no_filename_issue.jpg)

- User attempted to sign up without uploading image. 
- Fix: Have made flash message easier to understand requesting that user must add logo for sign up. 
- Have also introduced h6 heading above image upload to inform user that logo upload is required for sign up


#### Text Align Issue - Business Profile
![Colm-text_align_issue](testing_img_docs/colm-text_align_issue.jpg)

- Text has not scaled down properly for mobile and circles surrounding social media icons have gone wonky.  
- Fix: Above issues have been fixed through better grid management and centering a div


#### Text Overlap Issue - Offer Profile
![Colm-text_overlap_issue](testing_img_docs/colm-text_overlap.jpg)

- Text has not scaled down properly for mobile and causing overlap. 
- Fix: Now fixed. Better implemented the grid system for materialize to fix

#### File Upload Nothing Appearing - Business/Consumer/Offer Create
![file_upload_no_appear](testing_img_docs/imgfilename_notappearing.png)

- Nothing showing to user when they upload image
- Fix: Now fixed. Have introduced image preview window so user can see image they have selected

## Outstanding Bugs:
- Unfortunately could not find a way to allow files with gap in name to be uploaded to the app. Have included if statement that if this occurs the user will be prompted to rename file.

- Initial plans was to have both Business users and Consumer users login through the same portal however was unable to crack this. System (and me most likely) were unable to distinguish between the different users. To counteract this I made 2 seperate login portals for each user to login through (see below)

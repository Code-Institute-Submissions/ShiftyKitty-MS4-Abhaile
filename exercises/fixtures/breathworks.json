        "description": "Over time, our relationship with the world we live in has changed. Our lifestyles have disconnected us from the natural environment. \nBecause of this disconnection, our age-old survival mechanisms are no longer triggered and we’ve lost touch with our inner power.\nThrough decades of self-exploration and groundbreaking scientific studies, Wim has created a simple, effective way to stimulate these deep physiological processes and realise our full potential.",
        "how_to": "\nStep 1: Get Comfortable - Assume a meditation posture: sitting, lying down — whichever is most comfortable for you. Make sure you can expand your lungs freely without feeling any constriction.\nStep 2: 30-40 Deep Breaths - Close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Be conscious of your breath, and try to fully connect with it. Inhale deeply through the nose or mouth, and exhale unforced through the mouth. Fully inhale through the belly, then chest and then let go unforced. Repeat this 30 to 40 times in short, powerful bursts. You may experience light-headedness, and tingling sensations in your fingers and feet. These side effects are completely harmless.\nStep 3: The Hold - After the last exhalation, inhale one final time, as deeply as you can. Then let the air out and stop breathing. Hold until you feel the urge to breathe again.\nStep 4: Recovery Breath - When you feel the urge to breathe again, draw one big breath to fill your lungs. Feel your belly and chest expanding. When you are at full capacity, hold the breath for around 15 seconds, then let go. That completes round number one. This cycle can be repeated 3-4 times without interval. After having completed the breathing exercise, take your time to bask in the bliss. This calm state is highly conducive to meditation — don't hesitate to combine the two.",

        "description": "Breath of Fire is a form of pranayama, or breath control. Breath of Fire is also known as “skull shining breath” or Kapalabhati. In Sanskrit, “kapal” means “skull” or “forehead” and “bhati” means “illuminating.” During Breath of Fire, you inhale passively and exhale forcefully. The exhale, which requires you to contract your abdominal muscles, is the main focus of this technique.",
        "how_to": "\nStep 1: Start in a seated cross-legged position. Sit up tall.\nStep 2: Place your hands on your knees, palms facing upward. You can also place a hand on your belly to feel it rise as you breathe.\nStep 3: Inhale through your nose, feeling your belly expand as you do so.\nStep 4: Without pausing, exhale forcefully through your nose while contracting your abdominal muscles. Keep your inhales and exhales equal in length. Repeat until you’re comfortable with the pattern\nStep 5: The rhythm should be the same as a dog panting. Continue the rhythm, inhaling passively and exhaling forcefully. Repeat several times to practice.\nStep 6: Now, speed up the inhales and exhales. Your exhales should be powerful and loud.\nStep 7: Repeat for 30 seconds.\n",

However, you may choose to sit in any comfortable seated position for this practice: sitting cross-legged on the floor, kneeling, sitting on a chair or even your bed.\n2.\tAs you settle into your seat, close your eyes or lower your gaze. Notice the feeling of the ground, cushion, or chair beneath you and energetically ground down through your sit bones while lengthening through a long spine.\n3.\tBreath in and out through your nose. Relax your face and jaw, keeping the lips gently closed while allowing your teeth to remain separated.\n4.\tGently press your pointer fingers on the cartilage of your ears just below your cheek bones, blocking out any external sound. \n5.\tKeeping your ears blocked, take a deep breath in through your nose and exhale through your nose. On your exhale, make a humming or buzzing sound.\n6.\tContinue for at least 6 cycles of breath, or as long as you like.\n7.\tAfter completing Bhramari breathing, take a few moments to sit in silence and allow yourself to breathe naturally.",

Once we breathe, the lymph ducts send the lymph into our blood flow, then onto the liver where it metabolizes and then onto the kidneys where toxins are filtered.\nThe lymphatic system plays a key role in the immune system, fluid balance, and absorption of fats and fat-soluble nutrients.\nThe lymphatic system acts as a one-way drainage system transporting fluid from body tissues into the blood circulation and contains white blood cells called lymphocytes, which fight infection and gets rid of waste products produced by cells.\nLymph nodes\nLymph nodes are found throughout the body, but mainly in the neck, armpits, groin, and tummy (abdomen). They filter and break down bacteria (germs) or other harmful cells from the lymph fluid\nThe lymph nodes swell in response to infection, due to a build-up of lymph fluid, bacteria, or other organisms and immune system cells.\nWe recommend this exercise daily and ideally twice a day to get the Lymph system moving, exercise and rebounding are also great ways to get the lymph system moving.\n",

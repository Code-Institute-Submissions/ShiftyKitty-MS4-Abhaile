# Project Name - Abhaile


17/10/2021 <br>
The purpose of Project Abhaile is to create a wellness/wellbeing app that allows users to subscribe to different aspects (or all aspects) of the app based on their wellbeing needs. 
The initial stage of Project Abhaile will focus on breathwork, the benefits of breathwork and allow users to utilize different breathwork in their day to day lives in an app environment that is equal parts calming and engaging. 
The 4 different parts of Project Abhaile will be the following:
-	Fire
-	Water
-	Earth
-	Air

These 4 elements will essentially house the different breathworks. The user can subscribe to each individual element or subscribe to all 4 at an overall cheaper rate. 
The elements are associated with the following benefits:
-	Fire = Energy/Adrenaline/Burst/Red
-	Water = Intelligence/Focus/Creativity/Blue
-	Earth = Physical/Physical health benefits/Yellow+Brown
-	Air = Meditiation/Spirituaility/Balance/Mental Wellbeing/Destress/Teal-Green

By subscribing to an element gives the user full access to all the different exercises associated with that element.
In addition, there will be an online store selling merch dedicated to each element. This online store will be open to all users however, there will be discount perks and delivery perks that allow subscribed users to take advantage of. If a user is subscribed to all elements, they receive 15% off all products on site and free delivery. If user is subscribed to 1 element they receive 10% off products associated with that element. 
Eventually I would like to add more exercises that will improve wellbeing across the different elements that go outside the scope of breathwork. This may happen after this project.

## UX

The UX for this project will be investigated through the following 5 planes:

### Strategy Plane: <br>

Why are we special? Who are competitors? What are they doing? – There are multiple apps that offer wellness and wellbeing services to its users. The main apps that do this are Headspace and Calm. Both are essentially meditation apps that aim to destress and unwind their users and promote wellness. 

How Abhaile will differentiate from this is that it focuses on the different breathworks that aim to destress its users but also teach users various breathworks to improve energy, focus and physical wellbeing in addition to mental wellbeing within the user. All power comes from within so the aim of Abhaile is to bring this out of its users. 

Tech considerations? <br>
The purposes of this assignment is to build out an App using Python primarily through the Django framework and integrate Stripe payments. However, like all good apps,  this is built with mobile in mind. I will be building this from Mobile view out to desktop. 

Why would a user want this? <br>
Purpose of this app is to promote wellness and emotional improvement for its users through breathwork.


Who is my target audience? <br>
- The targeted demographic is incredibly broad. I want the only tools necessary to complete any exercise on this app to be the user and the app. After this, the user can be anyone trying to better themselves or trying to unwind and destress

- Project Abhaile is for general consumers but ideally(eventually) would like to see this app adopted by businesses/organizations to help its employees 

For Consumers: <br>
- Like any wellness app, consumers want an engaging experience that doesn’t feel like it’s a chore to access the app and participate in the exercises. The goal of the app is to give its users enough value to repeatedly come to the app on a daily basis 
- A good ecommerce experience for users is to make the shopping and buying experience as seamless as possible and with as few steps as possible to make a purchase. 
-  For this app, the user will be brought to home page. On homepage there will be 4 different tiles that have Fire, Water, Air and Earth. By hovering on each tile shows to user why one would want to subscribe to this element. 
-  A good experience would be one that is rewarding upon every use. In addition, good experience is one that is seamless and effortless. You do not want to be dreading the experience or putting it off. If this app is designed well, users would want to make this app a part of their day to day life
- As this app is a wellness app, users will mainly use this to feel well and motivated. This can be if user has experienced a tough day and needs to destress or needs to complete a task/project and needs to focus or improve concentration. 
- Before subscribing, user will need to consult their doc/gp before undergoing. If this app was to ever reach market in real life, all the practices would need to be medically cleared as this is holistic science, its practices are still more pseudo than factual
- After using, user would ideally feel the benefits immediately after practicing. 

For Businesses: <br>
- The aim of Project Abhaile is to help promote stress management within working environments. The end goal is to have an application that is the go to for businesses/organizations that want to help their employees wellbeing.

<br>

What are we making in the first place? <br>
We are making an app that helps to promote wellness and peace for its users (for a price). 
The goal is to have a wellness app that is equal parts fun, engaging and calming. From past experience, meditation and anything similar are difficult to repeatedly do. Other people who attempt to preach this practice state that the difficulty is due to the users subconcious not wanting to go through the changes associated for meditation as your mental state does change during such activities. To combat this might go outside the scope of this project but sure we will give it a go. 

A compelling user experience with any app is the ability to leave the user wanting more. In the instance of Project Abhaile, this may take up the shape of levels starting off on beginner exercises and progressing with the user. The more they participate, the more they will level up unlocking new and more difficult challenges. This again might be outside scope of project but something worth considering. 



How is our offering, or proposed offering, different from our competitors and substitutes? <br>
The difference in offering can be split into short term and long term. Short term is that I don’t think anyone else is separating the wellbeing into the categories of energy(fire), intelligence(water), mindfulness/enlightenment(air) and physical wellbeing (earth). Being able to succinctly tap into the element you want more of for that instance isn’t a concept I believe that has been explored too much by other wellness apps. Long term, my endgoal for this app is that it is something that is provided to everyone by the Government as it is seen as very beneficial to help people cope and succeed in their everyday lives. Eventually I would like more exercises that fall in line with the aforementioned categories that go beyond scope of breathwork. An encyclopadia/catalogue of wellness practices to help people. 

What can the user expect? <br>
User can expect an app that will be a massive benefit to them and the way they feel and their outlook on life.

### Acknowledgements 

- Would like to thank all friends and family who helped test this app and report back usability issues and technical bugs. 

- The name FruGaol comes from the word "Frugal" meaning thrifty or costing little and the Irish word "Gaol" which translates to relationships. Together it comes to Thrifty Relationships which was the inspiration behind this app and its purpose of connecting Businesses and Consumers through special deals and offers. 

- Many features were left out due to time constraints and lack of skill/knowledge however I will be building upon what is here in this project over time.
